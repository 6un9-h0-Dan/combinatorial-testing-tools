# Combinatorial Testing Tools #
Some of the NIST tools for combinatorial testing are available on this site.  

-> For the covering array generator tool ACTS, please email Rick Kuhn at kuhn@nist.gov.  ACTS is distributed separately. 

### Available on this Github directory
- PEV tool for testing rule-based expert systems or business rule engine/workflow systems.  
(runs on Java platforms;  GUI and command line versions here)  

- Combinatorial Coverage Measurement - computes a number of coverage measures of an existing test set.  Both at GUI and command-line version are included. (runs on Java platforms;  GUI and command line versions here) 

- Combinatorial Sequence Test Generator - generates sequence covering arrays, useful for event driven systems including GUIs, protocols, hardware testing. (C source, compile for target platform)

- Fault Identification tool - helps to narrow down the set of possible fault-triggering combinations in failing tests
Access Control Policy Test (ACPT) - uses combinatorial testing with model checking to produce tests for access control policies

### Separately distributed tools 
- Advanced Combinatorial Testing System (ACTS) - generates test sets that ensure t-way coverage of input parameter values; includes support for constraints and variable-strength tests.  Both at GUI and command-line version are included. (runs on Java platforms) -> contact Rick Kuhn at kuhn@nist.gov

- Web app Testing Tool - CPUT (Combinatorial-based Prioritization of User-session-based Testsuites) applies combinatorial methods to testing web applications. Test prioritization is used to make web app testing much more manageable. (runs on Java platforms) -> contact Renee Bryce at Univ of North Texas

- Access Control Policy Test (ACPT) - uses combinatorial testing with model checking to produce tests for access control policies -> contact Vincent Hu at NIST
